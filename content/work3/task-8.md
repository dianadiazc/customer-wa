**Amazon Route 53 health checks** monitor the health and performance of your web applications, web servers, and other resources. Each health check that you create can monitor one of the following:

* The health of a specified resource, such as a web server
* The status of other health checks
* The status of an Amazon CloudWatch alarm

In this task you will configure a health check to monitor the EC2 failure injection that you will test in the last activity of this Lab. 

1. Go to **Amazon Route 53** service.

{{% notice warning %}}
If you get this error message "Error creating health check. Invalid fully qualified domain name: It may not contain reserved characters of RFC1738 ";/?:@=&"." confirm the **Domain name** does not include "http://". The best option here is to copy the **DNS name** in the Load Balancer information from the **EC2 console**. 
{{% /notice %}}

6. To view the application health status select the health check you have just created, and in the below panel click on the **Monitoring** tab, after a couple of minutes you will see the app health check status. In the Health check status graph `1.0` will mean the application is **UP** and `0.0` will mean the application is **DOWN**.
