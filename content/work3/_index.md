The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle.

{{% notice note %}}
During the Well-Architected Framework Review (WAFR) you checked with other people at **AnyCompany** about how important is to build a resilient solution as required to protect against failure. Through those conversations, there was a clear understanding about the risks and business impact in case of failure. That is why you will help to implement a resilient architecture for the application.

## Objective

This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to improve reliability of a service by using automation to deploy a reliable cloud infrastructure. You will create additional subnets in a second Availability Zone, an ELB and an Auto Scaling group for the Web Application, applying the **Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability** design principle from the Well-Architected Framework. You will also migrate the database to RDS enabling multi-AZ. When your architecture is ready you will test it to ensure your implementation is resilient to failure, applying the **Testing recovery procedures** design principle.

## Services

Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ), ELB, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, AWS Secrets Manager

## Duration

Estimated time to complete: 1 hour and 10 min
